Hello my name is Ben Clark. I am a software engineer turned pretend mathematician. I am currently in grad school at Washington State University for a PhD in mathematics. 

This blog is a place for me to infrequently write about interesting math topics (and maybe other things) that I encounter. 

If you find a mistake in any of the posts send me an email at thrinador1@gmail.com and I will give you credits for fixing it.
