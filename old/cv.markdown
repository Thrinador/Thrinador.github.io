## Publications

### Polynomials that preserve nonnegative matrices of order two
Published Fall 2022 in the Mathematics Exchange

Preprint available at [arxiv.org/abs/2109.13365](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13365)

* Gave explicit conditions for a polynomial to preserve two-by-two nonnegative matrices.

* Explored what these conditions mean and gave further tests for satisfying these conditions.

### Polynomials that preserve nonnegative matrices
Published September 2021 in the journal of Linear Algebra and its Applications.

Preprint available at [arxiv.org/abs/2109.03360](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.03360)

* Explored what the set of polynomials that take nonnegative matrices as inputs and outputs look like.

* Derived several tests that would help determine if a given polynomial was in this set and found properties that these polynomials have.

* Further restricted the input set to special classes of nonnegative matrices, in particular the Jordan matrices and circulant matrices.

### Would gamers collaborate given the opportunity
Publishd August 2018 in FDG conference proceedings 

Publication available at [dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3235765.3236497](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3235765.3236497)

* Coauthored a paper/poster about video game collaboration. I presented the work at the FDG conference in Malm√∂ Sweden.

* The research was done by making a series of short games to test different aspects of cooperation. In each game players could collaborate, but did not need to. The question was if they were not prompted to collaborate, would they?

### Dean's List

* Made the dean's list 8 out of the 9 full credit quarters during my CSSE degree.

## Projects

### Matrix polynomial analysis
[github.com/Thrinador/matrix\_polynomial\_analysis](https://github.com/Thrinador/matrix_polynomial_analysis)

Topics: Rust, Optimization, Thread pools

* The goal of the project was to get a picture of what the space of polynomials that preserve the nonnegativity of matrices of a given size looks like.

* This is being done as a followup investigation into the research I did on polynomials that preserve nonnegative matrices.

* The main process is to generate a set of polynomials, then try and minimize their coefficients. Since there is no know test to see if a polynomial preserves nonnegative matrices after a minimization action is preformed the polynomial must be tested against a large set of matrices. This led to several performance optimization problems including thread pools, generating a large amount of random numbers, and race conditions.

* I did this project in rust because it is a very performant language and as a way of learning the language better.

### Brain Grid 
[github.com/UWB-Biocomputing/BrainGrid](https://github.com/UWB-Biocomputing/BrainGrid)

Topics: C++, Cuda, Optimization

* BrainGrid is an open-source spiking neural network simulator that is intended to aid scientists and researchers by providing pre-built code that can be easily modified to fit different models.

* Worked on optimizing the performance of the Cuda code through profiling different aspects of the kernel.

* Found and fixed a bug that reduced the number of memory allocations from 6 million to 10 thousand.

* Tuned the micro kernels and reduced the branching paths to give a 2 times speed up.

### Chess
[github.com/thrinador/Chess](https://github.com/Thrinador/Chess)

Topics: Java, JavaFX, Networking

* Wrote a GUI chess application in JavaFX using event driven programming.

* Improved the project as part of my networking class by adding server code and allowing clients to make lobbies and join games.
